								<p><strong>Hello world, my name is Megha.</strong></br> I am a twenty-four-year-old Australian living in Sydney. I grew up in Australia after being born in India. I am quadrilingual because I am fluent in four languages. I'd like to brush up on my French so that I can proudly say, “je peux parler frencais” meaning I can speak French.
I'll tell you a little bit about myself. My parents and I both follow the Hindu region. In 2007, we arrived in Australia. I was in year four when I came here, and I started my studies in Australia after that. I live with my parents, and I have a younger brother who is also a university student. </p>
							<p>When I'm not working or studying, you'll most likely find me reading or exploring lookouts with friends. I'm a dreamer, a thinker, an adventurer, and a creator.</p>
							<p> Presently at RMIT, I am studying Information Technology, which has always been a dream of mine. If you are also an RMIT student, feel free to contact me via my email: S3858020@student.rmit.edu.au and maybe we can work as a group so when you see my student number S3858020 then know it’s me. </p>
							<p> Ambiverts are people who I'm fascinated by various programming languages and eager to learn more about computers, both hardware, and software. Aside from computers, I love sports of all sorts. Throughout my high school years, I mainly participated in all sporting competitions and challenges.
Professionally, I work for a corporation as a Customer Service Leader. CSR positions have been a part of my previous work experience. I started working when I was 16 years old, so I was in year 10 when I started. Every work provided me with the knowledge and experience I needed to advance in life.</p>
							<p> Ambiverts are people who are both introverts and extroverts. If I'm out with friends or at home alone reading books or watching a movie, I'm equally satisfied. I am adaptable in several circumstances, which my friends appreciate because I can speak and listen when necessary.</p>
							<p>I'm still evolving and rising.</p>

							<article id="interest">
								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>My INTEREST IN IT and HOW & WHEN IT STARTed</h3>
								<p> Technology has the facility to impact lives at a calibre and scale that has never been realized in the history of mankind. The conception that something I engender can impact someone across the world now, or in the future is what drives my passion for Technology. IT has always been a great source of regalement for me since I was introduced to coding in primary and secondary grade. 

My passion for web development and software made me select information technology as a unit in year 9 and 10. I was able to gain rudimental skills and understand the mechanism. I believe by sanctioning your passion to become your purpose and one day it will become your profession and here I am perusing what my heart always wanted and desired to do. 

 </p>
								<p> Most of my IT experience is from self-education and working in different field and utilizing various software. 
I dote experimenting with different languages of computer, so I customarily spend my leisure time inscribing my own code or edifying myself an incipient coding language from rudimentary level. 

I have many different conceptions but at this point I am not sure how to shape them. Some of the conceptions can be put into action and few of them are really authentically but due to the lack of knowledge and experience, I have to take a step back every time. I spent time learning about building desktop or mobile applications from Code Academy and other sites but it’s hard as there is no mentor available when getting stuck. 

 </p>
								<p> I have wasted few years but now it was time where I make a propitious decision to pursue my career in IT. RMIT is the best path as it allows me to balance my work and study life as it offers an online learning. </p>

								<h3>CHOOSING RMIT </h3>
								<p> I am studying through OUA which offers range of different courses and certificates which can be pursue online or on campus. Why RMIT! Because it has the prestige, and it offers and allows me to choose from units which I would help me to gain the skills and understanding. As much I would love to move to Melbourne for the on-campus study but it’s hardly possible at the moment and it makes it so facile for the students like me to participate in learning without the trepidation of missing out. Allowing to choose from different specifications depending on the individuals interest is one of the best proposals. RMIT is great when it comes to providing great training making it beneficials in the careers in IT. I am exhilarated and grateful to have the opportunity to study with RMIT. </p>
								<h3> MY EXPECTIONS FROM THE DEGREE </h3>
								<p> I expect to learn a lot more about the IT industry during this degree. Learning how to design a system to finding a solution which utilises the technology to meet the needs of the users. I am really excited to development variants of applications on different devices and using various interface. Cloud technology is reaching the sky so being informative and insightful can avail me to create and development new ideas. Social media works as fire when it comes to generating brand awareness, leads or sales and also to engage with the target audience making an opportunity to build a career of it.</p>
								<p> Many diminutive businesses are not able to magnetise the immense group of audience, but website can help to establish the business. In fact, customers are so connected with the technology that they also expect owners to have an online presence so well designed, informative website is needed to add credibility to their business and strengthen their brand. I expect that I will be able to gain the knowledge, so I support the people who use them. Learning how to programme different languages like CSS, JavaScript or Python and HTML will support in the career I want to pursue after finishing the degree. </p>
							    <p>Everything has an ethical and unethical perspective and from this I will be able to recognise the difference when approaching various projects. While exploring the security side of computers and IT, I am excited to learn about UX design. 
Learning communication and writing skills with learning to deal with conflicts is very important as IT projects and jobs requires to work in teams. 
I strongly believe that theoretical and project experience with my diligence will give me the skills to develop IT infrastructures. With the support of programming, networking and date administration with client support will lead me to innovation in IT.

I was able to develop communication, interpersonal, and presentation skills when serving as a customer service agent, overseeing a team of ten or more workers, and as a CSR leader. Professionalism, a people-first mentality, and patience are three crucial P's that I learned while serving as a CSR. Professionalism is about the attitude which is taken towards the customers even in a situation where the customer is upset with the service and behaving immaturely. This is where the first P takes place and allows to diffuse the situation and present the company brand and values positively. The second P is remembering every client and customer will be different and at a different pace and giving them a flexible and creativity while offering them high-quality service. The third P reminds us that it is important to maintain and make a relationship with the customer rather than thinking about the money. These skills are valued skills that I can utilise in the future. </P>
								<P> Handling the management side and currently working as a CSR leader, I have learned that learning to let it go and empowering people at all levels of the organisation is very important and also trusting them to do the right thing. I have faced many significant challenges in these two roles and still learning new things every day. Being a good coach is an essential need of a CSR leader and that is to understand individual team members and support them in the right format. Formatting meetings, rewarding, one-to-one conversations are part of my routine. One of the skills I have gained is being proactive and resolving or finding the solution to the problems that occur in the business. Attention to the details, monitoring the team and project to make all the difference is also one of the skills that are required as a CSR leader. Communication and analytical skill help in my role. Documentation, using various software, participating in the meeting with directors and managers are included in my current position. </P>
								<P> I believe I do have the skills but there is a long path I will need to take to fit into the role my ideal job. By obtaining the qualification from RMIT and experience of few years in the IT field and evolving my skills and knowledge in software language will make me successful for the Tech Lead role. </P>

						<!-- Personal Profile -->
							<article id="personalProfile">
								<h2 class="major">PERSONAL PROFILE</h2>
								<P>To explore my learning style, imagination, personality, and personal values, I took three separate types of tests. My personality was classified as a logician in a 16-personality survey. I'm a visual learner, which was demonstrated by my learning style. My score on the test of imagination was 70.26. Both of these assessments measured my skills and stressed my characteristics. It helps me to see my current self and how I can change to become a better version of myself.</P>

								
								<h3>THESE RESULTS are important to me</h3>
								<P> Humans love the feeling of self-validation that comes with establishing who they are. These findings reveal a lot about myself, and the more I think about myself, the more I'll be able to assert what I need and whom I want to be. The rational personality is relatively unusual, accounting for just 3% of the population. I am proud of my ingenuity and imagination, as well as my unique insight and strong intellect. Being a logician, Albert Einstein is evidence that they are responsible for many scientific breakthroughs.</P>
								<P> Learn from the past, live in the moment, and hope for the future. Albert Einstein once said, "The important thing is not to avoid questioning." When it comes to a project or a job, I like to look for some connections and see if I can create an innovative product or concept. New challenges pique my interest. These personalities mean that I am a logician and demonstrate that I have a strong intellect and a vivid imagination. Logicians can conquer challenges that most people believe are insurmountable.</P>
								<P> I prefer reading or seeing pictures when it comes to learning styles. The same was mentioned in my learning style, indicating that I am a visual learner. When I'm learning a new skill or working on a new idea, visualisation comes in handy. It dispels any doubts and enables me to identify any missing elements as well as develop new and better solutions. In the creativity test, I received a score of 70.26, which is above average. This test describes various metrics across eight different sectors. The results indicate that I have the ability to abstract concepts from ideas and create associations between things that don't seem to be related at first. This capacity enables me to present a range of ideas in group projects at university or in real-life scenarios. According to the test, I can change one's viewpoint on a situation, which may be in terms of time and space as well as other people.</P>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/test1.png" alt="" /></span>
								<P> Curiosity about anything can contribute to change and progress in the world and a project. Bold people often push the envelope beyond what is required of them and knowing that I dare to do so makes me a valued member of the team. The majority of projects or jobs entail managing uncertainty in the work and being able to hold vast amounts of data and manipulate and handle the relationships between those data is a great skill to have and be proud about it. Complexity and persistence are synonyms, meaning a willingness to drive oneself to find new and better solutions even though good ones already exist. All of these characteristics, I believe, reflect my ability to collaborate effectively with others while also highlighting my personality and skills.</P>

								
								<h3>THESE RESULTS will INFLUENCE my BEHAVIOUR IN A TEAM</h3>
								<P>No two people are alike; each has its personality and characteristics. Working in a group helps you to pool your thoughts and look at things from multiple angles. Based on the test results, I believe I will only have a few questions to fully comprehend and visualize the issue. When working together, people will disagree, but my skills will be useful during this difficult period. To keep the team together, I'll have to use my abilities to show both the positive and negative sides of the problem or solution. My ability to abstract concepts would aid the team in generating ideas. We can accomplish a lot as a team, and my curiosity will help us do so. Overall, my attitude and creative abilities benefit the team.</P>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/test2.png" alt="" /></span>
								
								<h3>I WILL TakE THIS INTO ACCOUNT WHEN FORMING TEAMS</h3>
								<P>I believe I can form a team in which some members will combine their analytical skills with their visualizing abilities. If I'm stuck, I may seek assistance from someone with similar learning abilities, which will make it easier for me to grasp the idea. To be brave, I'll need to find a group of people who can also contribute their thoughts and perspectives. The logician in me would crave isolation while being mentally stimulated. Even in the most difficult situations, logicians stand out for their creative, resourceful, and hardworking personalities, and they offer successful solutions, so having a team that is similar to me is something I need to consider.</P>

								<h2 class="major">Project</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/project.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								
								<p> Gaze is a smartphone app that will use visual search technology to collect information about an item using the camera on the phone. Users may take a picture of an item and the app will show all of the object's details and information.</p>
								<p> According to the BBC, more than half of the world's population – figures range from 60 to 75 percent – speaks at least two languages.

After reading a few articles and studying people and my own day-to-day life, I came up with the definition of ‘Gaze’.
Even though English is my native language, there are times when I am uncertain about a product and am unable to explain it on the internet to find the correct word.
There are three parts to the software.
</p>
								<p> There is a company side and a customer side, as well as assisting people in obtaining correct information.
People who are stuck and uncertain about the name of an item or how to use a product will benefit from Gaze. It may be anything as easy as not knowing the name of a bird or an object in the kitchen. In this case, the user takes a picture or uploads a picture to the app, and the app begins searching for details. The user can choose the language in which they want to experience the content. This application will allow users to get the information they need in a matter of seconds, right at their fingertips. This app will assist in lowering the barriers.
</p>
								<p> Teenagers would be interested in learning about the world, and this app could become a new trend or gadget. They are learning new things in a fun way because they enjoy taking and sharing images, as shown by the rise in Instagram users.
Consumers may also use this app to search for an item by talking an image or searching by name to purchase an item. The first step is to take/scan for an object; the Gaze will locate the item, list the store name, and display the item's availability. If the consumer has all of the requisite details and wishes to purchase the item, they must choose a payment method. There will be the option of picking up or getting the item shipped to your house. The choice of picking up your order from the store or one of our Gaze locations will be open.
</p>
								<p> The Gaze can be very useful for small and local businesses. Small companies don't always have the time, energy, or capital to invest in a website or app. Gaze is a powerful weapon for them. Small companies must register their company and give us (Gaze) information about their background and products/food they provide. Using the same technique, customers may purchase or order food/products and choose their preferred method of delivery. Items can be shipped and collected, but food must be collected from the store; however, delivery is another choice open to consumers. Food delivery can operate in the same way as uber, or other delivery services do. These would also result in a large number of job vacancies for job seekers. Advertisements and subscriptions are welcome on Gaze. Businesses can pay every month, and Gaze can be used as a stakeholder or on a commission basis.

</p>
								<p>Gaze will be developed with the most up-to-date resources and technologies to meet users' current needs. To ensure the Gaze is creative and user-friendly, it is essential to choose the required programming language.

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that can be used on any iOS, Windows, or Android platform and supports object-oriented and functional programming. Since Gaze will include database access, it will also include PHP. We need to use the best programming language available when designing the Gaze, taking into account the features, reliability, efficiency, and how it will stand out in the market.
</p>
								<p> Software such as Eclipse or XCode can be used to build Gaze, but several other platforms can be useful in the creation of an application. XCode is a very user-friendly program with a 9.8 product quality score. When it comes to features, it has a variety of unique and useful features that can help to improve the application.

</p>
								<p> XCode's main features include the ability to evaluate, coding assistance, easy access, and user interface prototyping and configuration. Scheme management, code filters, and source control are all included. Helpful interfaces provide the best possible support for the user by offering an assist editor and tools while allowing the user to continue working without being interpreted. It assists in data retrieval so that the user does not have to spend time searching for it. Developers will be able to test the software to ensure that it is of high quality, that there are no bugs, that the interface is smooth, and that it is user-friendly. It helps you to make adjustments to the interface without having to close the graphical prototype. XCode has several schemes that developers can choose from depending on the job they're working on.
</p>
								<p> Eclipse is a Java IDE and framework that provides unrivalled extensibility for cloud and desktop deployments. Eclipse is a Java IDE and framework that provides unrivalled extensibility for cloud and desktop deployments. It allows users to create custom software and includes features such as git version control, debugging, XML editing, widget development, Gradle support, eclipse workspace, Releng, code recommendation, and a marketplace. The key advantage is that it works with Mac, Windows, and Linux devices, allowing for an extensible structure and unified workspace with high adaptability.</p>
								<p> To bring Gaze to life, a developer would need a wide range of abilities, including the ability to design a mobile app using a programming language. Awareness of the numerous software programs available and how to use them. They'll need the skills and qualifications to plan the basic user interface and create a working application with the functionality they want.Customer, company, and user features include location, camera, charts, information, and resources. This application would necessitate the qualifications and expertise of anyone who works on it. If I were to develop Gaze, I would face numerous challenges due to my lack of experience, ability, and education. I might have the ability to manage the project, but I will need all IT skills, which is similar to my ideal career.</p>
								<p> I'm looking forward to the day when I'll be able to render 'Gaze.'</p>
